## Discharge Education

Parents of newborns should receive brief, clear anticipatory guidance prior to discharge. The essential points to cover include the following.

— Urination frequency: At least 4 wet diapers per 24 hours initially, increasing to at least 6 wet diapers per 24 hours over the coming 3-4 days. 
- Stooling: frequency and appearance can be widely variable. Call PCP if stooling small hard pellets or if there is any blood in the stool.
- Feeding
    - Feed on demand, every 2-3 hours.
    - Do not allow infant to sleep through more than 1 feeding.
    - Do not give newborns water, honey, or any thing else to eat or drink other than breastmilk or formula.
- When to seek care:
    - Decreased urination
    - Poor feeding
    - Increasing jaundice
    - Redness or foul discharge at umbilical cord.
    - Worsening swelling or redness or purulent discharge at circumcision site. (Help parents understand the difference between purulent discharge and the yellowish eschar that typically forms during circumcision healing.)
    - Any fever of 100.4 or greater, measured by a rectal thermometer.
    - Any other concerns
— Keeping the infant safe
    - Car seat use
    - Supine sleeping alone, on a firm, flat surface free of smothering hazards.
    - Avoid exposure to second hand smoke.
    - Avoid prolonged carseat use for late preterm infants (i.e. only use carseat for travel, not as a pacifier)
    - Visitors should wash their hands or use hand sanitizer prior to touching or holding the baby.
- Soothing an infant
    - The "Five S's": swaddle, shush, sidelying, swing, suck. 
    - Review swaddling in a way that leaves legs free to flex at the hips
- NEVER, EVER SHAKE A BABY
    - Caring for a new baby can be really hard.
    - It's ok to leave a crying baby alone in a safe spot (such a supine in a crib) in another room while you give yourself a break.
