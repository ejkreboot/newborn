## Discharge Criteria

Infants are ready to discharge when they meet the following criteria:

- [ ] Stable vital signs for at least 12 hours
- [ ] Completed 2 feedings
- [ ] Urinated multiple times and stooled once
- [ ] [Family education](education.md) complete
- [ ] Hearing, metabolic, and pulse oximetry screenings complete. and follow up arranged, if indicated.
- [ ] Hyperbilirubinemia screening complete, and follow up arranged if indicated.
- [ ] PCP identified
- [ ] Maternal laboratory testing reviewed
- [ ] The infant has a safe home and social environment to be discharged to

In addition to the above criteria, late preterm infants should have a car seat test to ensure normal cardiorespiratory function when in a carseat.

Typically, it takes the better part of 48 hours to achieve all of these goals. If a patient is discharged prior to 48 hours, PCP follow up within 48 hours of discharge must be assured. 

Certain infants should not be discharged prior to 48 hours even if these criteria are met. These include late preterm infants, and infants who require 48 hours of observation due to concerns for sepsis.
