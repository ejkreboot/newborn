## Early Onset Sepsis

According the American Academy of Pediatric's [2019 guidelines](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/144/2/e20191881/38546/Management-of-Infants-at-Risk-for-Group-B), there are three approaches from which practitioners can choose when considering the evaluation and treatment of newborns at risk of early onset sepsis. Each of these are summarized below.

1. Categorical risk assessment.

Using this approach, if the newborn exhibits symptoms of sepsis **or** if the mother develops an intrapartum fever higher than 38.0C, blood cultures should be obtained and broad spectrum antibiotics should be initiated. The recommended antibiotics in this setting are ampicillin and either gentamycin--if no concern for meningitis--or an extended spectrum cephalosporin such as ceftazidime, cefepime, or cefotaxime.

In the absence of signs of infection affecting either infant or mother, no further evaluation or treatment is indicated. However, the infant should be observed for 36-48 hours if the mother was GBS+ and did not receive adequate prophylaxis. In this context, adequate prophylaxis means administration of  penicillin G, ampicillin, or cefazolin at least 4 hours prior to delivery. For the purposes of risk stratification, other antibiotics do not constitute adequate prophylaxis regardless of sensitivity testing because the algorithm accounts for other, non-GBS causes of neonatal sepsis that would not be covered by, for example, clindamycin.

If the mother's GBS status is unknown, a point of care NAAT test may be used to screen for GBS. However, the sensitivity of this test is lower than for culture. Therefore, prophylaxis is indicated if the mother develops intrapartum fever regardless of NAAT result. Prophylaxis is also indicated for onset of labor (or rupture of membranes) prior to 37 0/7 weeks gestational age. If the NAAT is negative and the mother remains asymptomatic, prophylaxis is not indicated assuming onset of labor (and rupture of membranes) at or after 37 /07 weeks gestational age. An excpetion is a history of GBS colonization with prior pregnancies, in which case prophylaxis should be "considered".
