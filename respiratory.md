## Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN)

TTN is the result of delayed reabsorption of amniotic fluid from the lungs. Risk factors include delivery via Cesarian section, especially if without labor, and maternal diabetes.

If obtained, chest radiograph may reveal increased vascularity, increased lung volumes, fluid in the fissures, effusion, and patchy infiltrates consistent with edema. This is in contrast to the diffuse, ground glass appearance seen in respiratory distress syndrome or frank infiltrates seen with pneumonia. 

TTN typically presents within a couple hours of birth, and generally resolves by 48 hours post delivery. Treatment is generally supportive, though some infants may benefit from CPAP or NIPPV.

## Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)

RDS is the result of decreased surfactant production and/or surfactant inactivation by meconium, blood, or inflammation. RDS generally affects very preterm infants (under 32 weeks gestational age). Treatment involves administration of exogenous surfactant and respiratory support, typically under the supervision of a neonatologist.

## Congenital heart disease

Congenital heart disease can lead to respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema or inadequate clearance of carbon dioxide due inadequate lung perfusion in the context of ductal dependant lesions. The presence of a congenital defect contributing to respiratory distress can be investigated via chest radiography and comparison of pre- and post-ductal saturations. Pre-ductal oxygen saturations below 95% (after peripartum transition), or a difference between pre- and post-ductal sats >3% (3 percentage points) is considered a positive screen. Definitive characterization of the cardiac anatomy requires a cardiac echo.
